#### Creating Personal Finance for Students
Our vision is to create a personal finance app specifically for **students**. We focus on the user interface design that promises **easy viewability**. We do so through an **intuitive** and **minimalist** design language. With features such as **saving goals** and **financial planning**, our app empowers every student in achieving financial independence. Our app is secured with conventional passwords or biometrics to safeguard all users' financial data.<br/>
## Milestone 1 (Ideation):
#### Problem Motivation
As students, it is common that we lose track of our expenses and overspend for the month. As we transition into adulthood, this can be a risky habit to maintain. Current bookkeeping apps available are often overloaded with functionalities that are irrelevant to students. Hence, we have envisioned a simple yet functional app that targets the needs of students.
#### Core Features
1. Adding of categorised daily expenses and income.
2. Summary page of monthly expenses and income.
3. Analysis page to show spending habits by category, spending trends, saving goals and financial planning.
4. Security features such as password or biometrics authentication.
5. Extension feature: page that shows current available student promotions from F&Bs
#### Design and Plan
- Basic login page (Milestone 2)
- Summary page of monthly expenses (Milestone 1)
- Adding page to choose category and add expenses and income (Milestone 1)
- Analysis page (Milestone 2)
- Promotions page (Milestone 3)
